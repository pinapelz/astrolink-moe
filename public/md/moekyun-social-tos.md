## Blatantly stolen from arks.cafe. I agree with pretty much everything there so no point in writing it all again.

**I donâ€™t really want to pull a discord admin so Iâ€™ll keep this simpleâ€¦**

Hereâ€™s a few rules from PSO2â€™s Official Discord that I think would well if applied in this space.

- No harassment of other players. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, misogyny, etc. are never allowed.
- Keep personal drama out of chat. Harassment in chat or DMs is never allowed regardless of how you feel about others.
- Use spoiler tags when appropriate.
- Respect the Terms of Service & Guidelines of both Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis and Discord.

Rule Extensions
- CW for spoilers are encouraged, specifically during the release weeks of new content
- Reasonable NSFW is allowed, but must be properly marked under CW.
- Common internet etiquette stuff applies here. Just donâ€™t be rude lmao
- Iâ€™m gonna be biased against doomposting, so please keep that stuff out of here. ðŸ¥²
- Datamine discussion is chill; just CW it since it is spoilers.
- Accounts made for the sole purpose of advertising entirely irrelevant products/services will be silenced, and associated posts will be deleted.
(please go to a more generalist instance and advertise there)

â€¦ ngl thatâ€™s pretty much it. I donâ€™t really look forward to moderating, so I trust that everyone here is a reasonable human being. If youâ€™d like to help out with moderation here, lmk!

# Transparency (mainly for those new to fedi)
As Iâ€™m hosting this myself, I technically have access to everyoneâ€™s emails as they sign up. Same goes with any traffic that goes to and from this website. Same goes of course for any files that are uploaded here, as well as notes that are marked as private.

Will I ever look at any of this? No. If you donâ€™t trust me in regards to stuff like that, itâ€™s totally understandable. I hope youâ€™re able to, though.

I will keep emails as requried for sign-up, as I think itâ€™s a good anti-spam measure
