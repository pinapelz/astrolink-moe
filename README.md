## ðŸš€ How to change the content?

To change the content of the templates, simply locate the ```user.json``` file inside the data folder. You can change the name, profession, and the links you want.

Oh, additionally, you have the entire iconography of [Remixicons](https://remixicon.com/) available. You just need to write the name of the icon within the ```"icon"``` key of each link in the ```user.json``` file.



## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
